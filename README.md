## Game Maker Studio Projects

### Unstoppable Evil competition05.exe 
a project submitted to a competition in 2010 for a designing a psp game.
### top-down-engine-example_05.exe 
an engine I had designed for topdown shooter 
### MobileZombieGameEngine.exe 
This was game was designed for phones.  Uses's a multitouch screen code that 
I had developed from scatch, The enemies have 3 states.  idle, wander, and chase. 
If the enemy is somehow alerted, it starts wandering near the player.
The enemy starts chasing once the player enter's the field of view of the zombie.
The game features some code that solves the point and shoot issue of mobile games.
1st) there is no analog stick on the screen. you can use the whole screen as  an analog stick
this feature introduced the issue of shooting unintentionally, so it was solved by this
mechanism.  a tap is considered a single fire.  a double tap + hold is considered automatic fire.
I was trying to integrate network play but never finished it.
